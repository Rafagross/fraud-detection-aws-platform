# aws-cloudops-private-ec2-operations-platform

A reference AWS CloudOps platform for operating EC2 workloads in private subnets with no public SSH, no bastion hosts, and no key pairs. Operator access is exclusively through SSM Session Manager over VPC Interface Endpoints. Workloads run on hardened Golden AMIs produced by EC2 Image Builder, encrypted with a customer-managed KMS key, monitored with the CloudWatch Agent, and protected by AWS Backup with lifecycle-managed retention.

Designed as a production-pattern reference, not a tutorial. Targets under $100/month in `us-east-1`.

---

## Why this exists

Most public examples for "EC2 on AWS" still teach SSH key pairs, public bastions, and `0.0.0.0/0` security group rules. That pattern carries operational debt — key rotation, audit gaps, brute-force exposure, bastion sprawl — that doesn't belong in a 2026 environment. This project demonstrates the alternative as it is actually built in well-run AWS shops:

- No inbound network access to workload instances.
- Identity-based access through IAM and SSM, fully audited, encrypted, MFA-gated.
- Immutable infrastructure via Golden AMIs and Launch Templates.
- Self-healing through an Auto Scaling Group sized at `min=max=1`.
- Encryption everywhere with a customer-managed KMS key.
- Backups with cold-storage lifecycle and a documented restore drill.
- Cost held under $100/month through deliberate trade-offs (no NAT Gateway, single CMK, Graviton compute).

The platform hosts a small fictional service called `heartbeat-api` — a Go binary exposing `/health`, `/metrics`, and a load-simulation endpoint — so the runbooks, alarms, and Run Command documents have something real to operate on.

## What this platform does

| Capability | How |
|---|---|
| Operator shell access | SSM Session Manager over VPC Interface Endpoints, MFA-required, fully logged to CloudWatch |
| Ad-hoc and scheduled operations | SSM Run Command with versioned documents |
| Configuration management | SSM Parameter Store (Standard tier, SecureString where needed) |
| Patching | SSM Patch Manager with a tag-targeted Maintenance Window |
| Observability | CloudWatch Agent (system + custom metrics), CloudWatch Logs, alarms on CPU/memory/disk/status, dashboard |
| Alerting | EventBridge → SNS → email (Slack/PagerDuty deferred) |
| Backup and recovery | AWS Backup, daily snapshots, 7d warm + 30d cold, KMS-encrypted vault |
| Immutable infrastructure | EC2 Image Builder produces Golden AL2023 arm64 AMIs; Launch Template references the AMI ID via SSM Parameter |
| Self-healing | Auto Scaling Group `min=max=1` across two AZs replaces failed instances automatically |
| Encryption | Customer-managed KMS key for EBS, CloudWatch Logs, AWS Backup vault, SSM session logs |

## Cost summary

| Item | Estimate (monthly, us-east-1) |
|---|---|
| `t4g.micro` EC2 (730h, on-demand) | ~$6.00 |
| EBS gp3 30 GB encrypted | ~$2.40 |
| 5 × VPC Interface Endpoints | ~$36.50 |
| CloudWatch Logs (1 GB ingest, 7-day retention) | ~$0.55 |
| CloudWatch metrics + alarms | ~$1–2 |
| CloudWatch Dashboard (×1) | ~$3.00 |
| AWS Backup (~30 GB warm + cold) | ~$3–5 |
| KMS CMK | ~$1.00 |
| EC2 Image Builder (~1 build/month, t3.medium minutes) | <$1.00 |
| SNS (email, low volume) | ~$0 |
| **Total** | **~$53–58/month** |

Detailed cost model and the avoided-cost decisions are in [`docs/cost-model.md`](docs/cost-model.md).

The single largest line item is VPC Interface Endpoints. Forgetting to destroy the environment is the failure mode; an AWS Budgets alert at 50% / 80% / 100% of the $100 ceiling is part of the deploy.

## Status and roadmap

**MVP (this repo, current scope):**
VPC + endpoints, KMS, IAM, ASG-managed EC2 with Golden AMI, CloudWatch Agent + alarms, AWS Backup, EventBridge → SNS, SSM session logging, Patch Manager, CI checks, runbooks, ADRs.

**Phase 2 enhancements (planned, not in this repo):**
- OIDC-based GitHub Actions deploy pipeline (plan on PR, apply on merge to `main`).
- Multi-region AMI distribution.
- AWS Config + a conformance pack scoped to the platform.
- GuardDuty + Security Hub.
- Cross-account / cross-region backup vault copy with Vault Lock.
- Inspector vulnerability scanning in the Image Builder pipeline.
- Slack/PagerDuty integration for SNS.

**Explicit non-goals:**
A managed database (no application use case), Kubernetes (out of scope for an EC2-pattern reference), multi-account org structure (assumed to exist; this is a workload-account pattern), human IAM/SSO design (assumed to exist).

---

## Prerequisites assumed

- AWS account with CloudTrail enabled at the account or organization level (this repo does not provision a trail).
- Terraform `>= 1.6`, AWS provider `>= 5.x`.
- AWS CLI v2 configured with credentials for an IAM role that can assume the deploy role.
- For SSM Session Manager: the AWS CLI Session Manager plugin installed locally.
